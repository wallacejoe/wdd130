    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>The primary purposes of my website are to attract and educate clients.
        To accomplish these goals, I will show potential clients what we have to
        offer as far as location and adventures. We will also offer a week-long
        training course to help begginers feel confident on the water. My goal
        is for this to be a fun, safe place for customers to come and enjoy
        experiencing what nature has to offer. This site should help customers
        determine which adventures they are best suited for and describe the
        precautions we have in place to ensure the safety of our guests.
    </p>

        than 10 who pass a health screening. Fitness tests will be required of
        anyone wanting the more difficult adventures. Minors must be accompanied
        by an adult.
